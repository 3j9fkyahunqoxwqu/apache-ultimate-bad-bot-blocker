# PULL REQUEST Instructions for Apache Bad Bot and Spam Referrer Blocker

Please send any pull requests by adding your referers to the badreferers.list file 
in this directory. This helps me keep changes synchronized across both the Apache Bad Bat and Spam Referrer Blocker
as well as the Nginx Bad Bot and Spam Referrer Blocker which use this same centralised list of bad referrers.

Thank you for contributing to help produce the most extensive bad bot and spam referrer
blocker script.
